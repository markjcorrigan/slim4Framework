Hi there.

I was fiddling with Chris's course and converted up to lesson 5 into Slim 4 Framework.
I simply downloaded the Slim 4 Framework and started coding using the MVC approach.
The routes should give you an idea of what is what.
Also I used Twigg as the templating engine.

I used mysql and created a database called slim app.  
The sql dump of the tables is in this folder.
I only use "users", "bikes" and "records".  You can ignore the other tables.
Go to config/settings and add in your own mysql name and password.

The routes below should all work.
    $app->get('/', HomeAction::class)->setName('home');

    $app->get('/helloworld', HelloAction::class)->setName('hello'); //Lesson one

    $app->get('/hi/{nameholder}', HiAction::class); //Lesson two

    $app->get('/hello/{name}', ParamsAction::class)->setName('params'); //Lesson two

    $app->get('/first', 'App\Controller\FirstController:homepage');

    $app->get('/second', 'App\Controller\SecondController:second');

    $app->get('/loop', 'App\Controller\LoopController:loop');

    $app->any('/home', 'App\Controller\SearchController:records');

    $app->any('/search', '\App\Controller\SearchController:search');

    $app->any('/form', '\App\Controller\SearchController:form');

    $app->any('/default', '\App\Controller\ShopController:default');

    $app->get('/details/{id:[0-9]+}', '\App\Controller\ShopController:details');

I did struggle with the error handling as I am unable to get this to work using the course code.
Possibly Chris can help.
