# Logging

## Introduction

To help you learn more about what's happening within your application, 
this Slim skeleton provides robust logging services that allow you to log messages to files, 
the system error log, and even to Slack to notify your entire team.

This project uses the [Monolog](https://seldaek.github.io/monolog/) package,
which provides support for a variety of powerful log handlers.

## Configuration

The default settings are stored in `config/defaults.php`, `$settings['logger']`

The directory for all log files is: `logs/`
